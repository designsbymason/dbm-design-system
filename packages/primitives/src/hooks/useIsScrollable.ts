/**
 * Tracks whether a scroll container's content currently overflows it along
 * the axis (or axes) actually offered, so the container becomes a
 * keyboard-reachable region (WCAG 2.1.1) only while it genuinely scrolls —
 * not a permanent, meaningless tab stop on content that already fits.
 *
 * Built on `useSyncExternalStore`: React re-reads the snapshot right after
 * the first commit and, if it changed, re-renders synchronously before
 * paint — an effect-plus-state version only learns about overflow one tick
 * later, a real `scrollable-region-focusable` failure the instant a story
 * with overflowing content first renders.
 *
 * Shared between `ScrollArea` (which needs a specific axis) and `Table`'s
 * own `useScrollableRegion` (always `"both"`, combined with its own
 * separate `captionId` lookup) — extracted here 2026-10-02 once a second
 * consumer needed the identical overflow-detection logic, matching the
 * precedent `useResolvedResponsiveValue` already set for this package (a
 * shared hook extracted once a genuine second consumer showed up, rather
 * than speculatively upfront).
 *
 * Subsequent changes (viewport resize, content change) arrive via
 * `ResizeObserver` on both the container and its first child. Guarded for
 * environments without it: those just never re-check after the first
 * commit, leaving the container unfocusable rather than crashing.
