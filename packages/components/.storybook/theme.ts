/**
 * Storybook's manager UI (sidebar/toolbar chrome) and the Docs addon's own
 * typography both run outside the preview iframe, so neither has access to
 * our CSS custom properties — each generated theme below mirrors a brand's
 * resolved semantic token values (light/dark) as literal hex/font strings
 * instead. `.storybook/manager.ts` and `.storybook/DbmDocsContainer.tsx`
 * both listen for the Brand AND Mode toolbar globals on the addons channel
 * and switch between these live via `getStorybookTheme`, so the manager
 * chrome and the Docs wrapper now track the same two toggles that theme
 * previewed components (see the `withTheme` decorator in preview.tsx) —
 * this reverses an earlier decision (see git history) that manager/docs
 * chrome would stay fixed to purple regardless of the Brand toggle.
 *
 * Rather than hand-transcribing hex per brand/mode (drift-prone — this
 * file used to do exactly that for purple only, and its dark variant had
 * silently gone stale on `appBorderRadius`/`inputBorderRadius`, off by 2px
 * from the `radius.md`/`radius.sm` tokens its own comments named), every
 * value below is read directly from `@dbm-design-system/tokens`'s built
 * semantic exports (`purpleLight`/`purpleDark`/`emeraldLight`/
 * `emeraldDark` — already-resolved `{ bg, text, border, icon }` hex maps,
 * confirmed via `node -e "require('./dist/index.cjs')"`) and the
 * `primitives.radius` scale. Adding a third brand later means adding one
 * import and one `BRANDS` entry below — nothing else in this file, or in
 * `manager.ts`/`DbmDocsContainer.tsx`, needs to change.
 *
 * One correctness note found while building this: `text["on-brand"]` is
 * white in light mode for both brands, but **`#2C2A34` (gray.900, dark
 * text) in dark mode for both brands** (2026-08-21 — previously this was
 * split per brand, white for purple and a different dark gray for
 * emerald, an accumulated inconsistency rather than a designed one; both
 * `bg.brand`'s own dark value and `text.on-brand`'s dark value were
 * unified the same day, see guidelines/03-token-system-spec.md).
 * `textInverseColor` below reads `t.text["on-brand"]` per brand/mode
 * rather than assuming white, which the old purple-only file did —
 * assuming white would make dark mode's selected sidebar item illegible
 * (light text on a now-light brand-tinted background) in both brands.
