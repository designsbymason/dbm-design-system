       * enough that its single unbroken word alone exceeds the viewport
       * doesn't wrap at all — flex items default to `min-width: auto`,
       * which floors their shrink at the *unbreakable* content width, and
       * a CamelCase component name has no natural break point (no spaces)
       * for the browser to wrap on. `flexWrap` above (the earlier,
       * 2026-08-22 fix) only solves title+badge wrapping onto two lines;
       * it does nothing once the title alone is already wider than the
       * viewport. Same property, same root cause, and the same fix
       * already applied to `.sbdocs-content p`/`li` in docs.css for
       * markdown prose containing an unbreakable run of text — just not
       * previously needed here since no title had hit this length yet.
