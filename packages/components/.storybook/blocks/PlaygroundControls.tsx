/**
 * The Playground section's compact controls panel — a custom-rendered
 * replacement for Storybook's own `<Controls of={X}>` block (see
 * guidelines/07-storybook-and-documentation-standards.md §4 and this
 * component's introduction in the commit that added it for the full
 * rationale: Storybook's ArgsTable renders every row as two separately-
 * boxed table cells, which no CSS override can turn into "one border
 * around the whole panel" once `border-collapse` no longer applies).
 * Same `of`/`exclude` API as `<Controls>` for a drop-in swap at the MDX
 * call site.
 *
 * Layout is inline styles with `var(--dbm-*)` tokens, matching every other
 * docs-only block in this folder (`RelatedCard`, `ColorSwatch`,
 * `TypeSpecimen`) rather than a CSS Module — those are for the published
 * component library; this is Storybook-only tooling. The one exception is
 * the row grid itself (`.dbm-playground-controls-grid`, in `docs.css`):
 * stacking to a single column below `breakpoint.sm` needs a real media
 * query, which inline styles can't express. Deliberately no divider lines
 * between rows, only the outer card gets a border — spacing alone
 * separates rows, so there's no ambiguity about a border being "around" a
 * field.
 *
 * `order` mirrors `PropertiesTable`'s prop of the same name (same
 * `sortEntriesByOrder` helper) — pass the same array to both so a
 * component's docs page defines one sensible prop reading order and reuses
 * it for the full Properties table and this compact panel alike.
 *
 * The "Reset to defaults" control sits outside/below the bordered card,
 * left-aligned (moved 2026-09-06, at explicit direction, from a top-right
 * icon-only `IconButton` inside the card) — mirroring how the Canvas
 * block's own native "Show code"/"Copy code" controls sit below *its* box
 * rather than inside it. The visible label means a `Tooltip` restating
 * the same text is no longer needed.
 *
 * Styled to match those same native "Show code"/"Copy code" buttons
 * (revised 2026-09-06, at explicit direction, same session, in two passes
 * — the first pass covered color/size/spacing; a follow-up, same day,
 * caught two more real mismatches: border-radius (8px vs. the reference's
 * 4px) and hover behavior (the reference's icon+text switch to brand color
 * on hover; this button's didn't change color at all)) — read the
 * reference's real computed style directly rather than guessing:
 * `color: gray.700` (byte-identical to `text.secondary`), `font-size: 12px`
 * (`font-size.xs`), `font-weight: 700` (`font-weight.bold`),
 * `border-radius: 4px` (`radius.sm`), `height: 28px`, `padding: 0 10px`,
 * `gap: 6px`, no background/border at rest, `color: purple.600`
 * (`text.brand`) on hover — confirmed byte-identical afterward via
 * `getComputedStyle` on both buttons side by side, not just eyeballed.
 *
 * `Button`'s own `tertiary` variant (transparent background, native
 * focus-visible ring — both kept) is the base rather than a from-scratch
 * element, styled via the dedicated `.dbm-playground-reset-button` class
 * in `docs.css` — **not inline `style`, which was this component's own
 * first-pass approach and is exactly why the hover color never worked**:
 * an inline `style` attribute's specificity beats any external rule
 * regardless of pseudo-class, so a `:hover` rule in a stylesheet can never
 * override a color set via `style` on the same element, only ever a class.
 * The real CSS class's own rest-state declarations need `!important` to
 * reliably beat `Button.module.css`'s own same-specificity classes
 * (`.root`/`.sizeXs`/`.variantTertiary`, each a single class selector, same
 * weight as this one) regardless of which stylesheet happens to load
 * later in the bundle — the identical reasoning already documented for
 * `.sbdocs-content code` earlier in this file. The `:hover` rule itself
 * doesn't need `!important`: a class+pseudo-class selector is inherently
 * *more* specific than a plain class, so it wins on its own.
 *
 * The icon is composed into `children` instead of passed as `leadingIcon`
 * — `Button` always colors a `leadingIcon` via a variant-locked `tone`
 * (`iconToneForVariant`, `Button.tsx`) rather than inheriting the label's
 * own color, so it would stay brand-purple regardless of any override on
 * the button itself, confirmed by reading `Button.tsx` directly. Deliberately
 * given no `tone` prop at all (unlike the first pass, which used
 * `tone="default"`) — `Icon`'s own doc comment states it inherits
 * `currentColor` when `tone` is omitted, which is exactly what makes the
 * icon track the button's own color automatically, hover included, with
 * no separate icon-specific override needed.
 *
 * `border-radius`/`height`/`padding`/`gap` are literal pixel values, not
 * `--dbm-space-*`/`--dbm-radius-*` steps — none of 4px/28px/10px/6px lands
 * on those scales, and the whole point here is matching an external
 * reference (Storybook's own manager-chrome buttons, which don't derive
 * from this system's tokens at all), not picking the nearest token and
 * accepting a visible mismatch. Same accepted-literal category as the
 * story-wrapper-sizing/media-query exceptions already documented in
 * `07-storybook-and-documentation-standards.md` §8.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all — no card, no "Reset to defaults" — when a
 * component has zero genuinely live-editable props after `exclude`/
 * `control: false` filtering (added 2026-09-06, at explicit direction, via
 * Spacer): a card with no rows inside plus a reset button with nothing to
 * reset is dead UI, not an empty-but-valid state worth showing.
