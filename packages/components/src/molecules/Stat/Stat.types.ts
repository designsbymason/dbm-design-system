 *   that sits inside a container that already provides its own boundary (a
 *   `Card`, a dashboard grid cell). `Stat.Icon`'s badge is a light,
 *   `tone`-tinted fill.
 * - `"outlined"` — a border around the stat, for a self-contained "stat
 *   card" with no wrapping `Card` — also `tone`-tinted, a decorative accent
 *   rather than a stronger, state-identifying one. The icon badge is the
 *   same light fill `ghost` uses.
 * - `"filled"` — a light, `tone`-tinted fill across the whole stat (plain
 *   neutral when `tone` is left at its default), and `Stat.Icon`'s own badge
 *   becomes a solid, saturated fill of that same tone instead of the light
 *   one the other two variants use.
