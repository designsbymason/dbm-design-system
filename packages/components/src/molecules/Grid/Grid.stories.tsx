// instead of it already filling the whole thing. The earlier overflow/
// dead-space concern that motivated percentage sizing no longer applies:

// A decorative overlay, one stripe per grid *cell* (not one continuous
// stripe per column) — added 2026-09-11, at explicit user direction, to
// make spanning/gaps/auto-placement easier to read at a glance; redesigned
// 2026-09-12, user-reported ("I see the vertical gap, but... no white space
// between the rows"): the original design rendered exactly `columns` many
// stripes, each explicitly spanning the *entire* height in one continuous
// block — column-gaps showed correctly (real CSS `gap` between adjacent
// stripes), but since each column was only ever one uninterrupted stripe,
// there was no row boundary anywhere for a row-gap to visibly break. Fixed
// by rendering `count` many ordinary, uniformly-sized stripes with no
// explicit position at all, letting the *same* CSS Grid auto-placement
// algorithm the real content uses lay them out — real row-gaps now appear
// naturally between every row, for free, exactly where the real grid's own
// rows break.
//
// Deliberately NOT implemented as extra grid items inside the *real* grid
// (the first approach tried, still correct as a reason to avoid it): a
// ghost item mixed into the real grid's own children competes with the
// real content for auto-placement slots — confirmed against the spec
// before building this, not assumed. Runs its own separate absolutely-
// positioned nested grid instead, matching the real grid's `columns`/`gap`
// exactly so its track boundaries land pixel-for-pixel on the real ones,
// with zero interaction with the real grid's own placement algorithm.
//
// Requires the real `<Grid>` to have both `position: "relative"` AND an
// explicit `zIndex: 0` in its own style — found and fixed 2026-09-11,
// user-reported "not displayed at all": `position: "relative"` alone does
// not establish a new CSS stacking context (only `position` combined with
// a non-`auto` `z-index` does), so without an explicit `zIndex` on `Grid`
// itself, the overlay's `zIndex: -1` doesn't resolve locally against its
// own parent — it escapes to whichever ancestor further up the tree *does*
// establish one, painting behind that instead and disappearing entirely.
// Confirmed by direct experiment: setting `zIndex: 0` on `Grid` alone (with
// the overlay still at `zIndex: -1`) was the one change that made the
// overlay actually visible, behind the real content, exactly as intended.
