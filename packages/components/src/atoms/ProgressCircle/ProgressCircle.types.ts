// `aria-valuenow`/`aria-valuemin`/`aria-valuemax` are deliberately omitted

// component computes and sets all three itself from `value`/`max`. Without
// this, a consumer-passed value of the same name would silently win over
// the computed one (native props spread after the component's own explicit
// attributes), desyncing the announced state from what's actually on
// screen — a real bug found and fixed during ProgressBar's review, and
// reproduced/fixed here for its own sibling. Note this `Omit` alone doesn't
// actually block `aria-*` names at the type level (TypeScript's JSX
// checker exempts them from prop-type checking regardless of the declared
// type) — the real fix is the JSX attribute ordering in ProgressCircle.tsx.
