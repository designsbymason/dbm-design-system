# Stat — Storybook/component review findings

**Data Display:** Stat — built 2026-09-27, item 22 in the itemized molecule-tier build order (`04-component-inventory.md`), where the row is
listed as `Stat / KPI` — the two names refer to the same component; it ships as `Stat`, the same convention `Tag / Chip` already set (the first
name in a dual-named row is what gets built). Adds no dependency and no component token, reusing existing status tokens for `Stat.Trend`'s
colour. **Not yet Finalized** — built directly against the full `06-engineering-standards.md` §9 checklist in one session, including a final
review pass (see below for what that found and fixed), and awaiting the user's own Finalized declaration.

A compound component: `Stat` (root) with `Stat.Icon`, `Stat.Label`, `Stat.Value` (usually holding a `Stat.Trend`), and `Stat.Description`, every
one optional, in reading order.

## Decisions made during the build

- **The component name.** The inventory's own row reads `Stat / KPI`. Asked directly rather than assumed: ships as `Stat`, following the
  `Tag / Chip` precedent (`05-component-api-conventions.md` §2's "match the name in `04-component-inventory.md` exactly," applied to a
  dual-named row by taking the first name).
- **`Stat.Trend` takes one signed number, not a `direction` enum plus a separate magnitude.** `value={-4.2}` is both the number shown and the
  thing that decides the icon (up, down, or a dash for exactly `0`) and, together with `goodDirection`, the colour. Considered and rejected: a
  `direction: "increase" | "decrease"` prop alongside a `value`, which would let the two disagree (a "decrease" direction with a positive
  number) — deriving the direction from the sign is the only shape that can't be internally inconsistent. This is `Stat`'s own decision, not
  escalated to an ADR: it's self-contained (no other component currently has a "trend" concept to be consistent with), unlike `labels`/
  `formatNumber` (ADR-0021) or the settings-context pattern (ADR-0025), each of which was explicitly framed as a convention other components
  would also need.
- **`goodDirection`, not a fixed "up is good" assumption.** A support-ticket count, an error rate, or a cost going *down* is the improvement — the
  default (`"increase"`) fits the more common case (revenue, users, sales) but a metric where less is better needs the colours the other way
  round, and that's a real, common enough case in comparable production dashboards to build in from the start rather than leave as a named gap.
- **`Stat.Trend`'s accessible name needs `role="img"` on its own `<span>`.** `aria-label` on a plain `<span>` has no role that permits it —
  confirmed live by jest-axe (`aria-prohibited-attr`), not assumed. `role="img"` is the same fix `Avatar` already uses to flatten a composite
  visual (an icon plus a number, here) into one named unit, rather than a new pattern.
- **`announce` follows `Pagination`'s "never the first appearance" rule, not `EmptyState`'s "announce on appearance" one.** The two existing
  `announce` precedents in this system answer different questions: `EmptyState`'s announces because *content that wasn't there is now visible* on
  the page; `Pagination`'s announces because *a value that was already visible changed to a different one*. A stat's own value is closer to
  the second case (a live dashboard updates a number that was already showing), so the first render is remembered but never announced, exactly
  like `Pagination`'s own `previousPage` ref — not `EmptyState`'s "fill on mount" behaviour.
- **Orientation's `horizontal` case is a two-column CSS grid, not a flex row.** `Stat.Icon` needs to sit beside *all* of `Stat.Label`/`Value`/
  `Description` stacked together, not just the next one — a plain flex row can't do that without an extra wrapper `<div>` this component doesn't
  render (the same class of problem `Tabs`' own vertical-overflow work ran into and solved with CSS Grid rather than `display: contents`, whose
  specificity conflicts with a part's own `display` — considered here first and rejected for the identical reason). `grid-row: 1 / -1` on the
  icon badge spans however many rows the other parts end up needing, so it works regardless of which parts are actually present.
- **No `align` prop.** Unlike `EmptyState` (often centred on a whole page), a stat tile reads left-to-right down a column and doesn't have a
  comparable centring use case; adding one without a concrete need would be scope creep the guardrail in `06-engineering-standards.md` §9
  explicitly warns against.
- **`Stat.Value`'s digits are `tabular-nums` and don't wrap.** A live value that changes in place shouldn't shift the layout next to it as it
  gains or loses digits (the same reasoning `Slider`'s value label and `Pagination`'s numbers already established) — mirrored here for a value's
  *own* width, not just its neighbour's position.

## Radix-primitive prop audit

Not applicable — `Stat` wraps no Radix primitive. It's a small compound component in the same category as `Card`/`EmptyState`.

## Baseline correctness

- [x] Full "definition of done" (`05-component-api-conventions.md` §8) — file structure, no `any`, JSDoc on every prop, a story per
  variant/size/state, a unit test covering rendering and interaction, jest-axe clean, keyboard verified (there is none — static content), every
  new colour pairing reuses an already-verified token, exported from the public `index.ts`, no hardcoded values.
- [x] `forwardRef` on every part; `className`/`style`/`id`/`data-testid` accepted on every part; no controlled/uncontrolled pair needed (nothing
  here holds interactive state); no `asChild` (nothing here composes onto another element's role).
- [x] Commonly-relevant native props audited: `Stat` extends `<div>`, `Stat.Label`/`Value`/`Description` extend `<p>` (with `color` omitted, the
  same obsolete-attribute clash `EmptyState.Title` already found and excluded), `Stat.Icon` extends `<div>`, `Stat.Trend` extends `<span>`.
- [x] `{...props}` spread before every explicit, computed attribute (`data-orientation`, `data-direction`, `data-sentiment`,
  `data-stat-trend-label`, `aria-label`, `role`) in every part's JSX — read directly, not inferred.
- [x] `Stat.Trend`'s `labels` override merges with `mergeDefined`, not a plain object spread — `{ increase: () => "custom" }` alone still falls
  back to the real default for `decrease`/`flat` (tested).
- [x] No text-parsing/regex work here (nothing runs a pattern over untrusted length-unbounded text) — not applicable.
- [x] No console noise in production; no silent `catch`; nothing here has an invalid-combination case to warn about (`Stat.Trend`'s `value`
  is a plain number with no invalid state — `0` is a legitimate, meaningful "flat" value, not an error).
- [x] SSR/RSC safety — no `window`/`document`/`localStorage` access outside the `announce` effect, which only runs client-side via `useEffect`
  already.
- [x] Survives `StrictMode` — `announce`'s own remembered-text ref is cleared on unmount, the same pattern `EmptyState`'s `announced` ref uses,
  confirmed by a StrictMode test (mount → unmount → remount still announces a real later change, not a false "already seen").
- [x] Original implementation — Radix is not involved at all; the styling, API shape, and visual identity are this system's own.
- [x] Compound-component sub-part completeness — every sub-part (`Icon`/`Label`/`Value`/`Trend`/`Description`) has `forwardRef`, full JSDoc,
  and `className`/`style`/`id`/`data-testid`.
- [x] Atom-reuse audit — composes `Icon`, `Text`, and `VisuallyHidden` directly rather than re-implementing icon rendering, typography, or the
  status region.
- [x] A component providing context to its children (`StatSizeContext`) tested nested inside itself — an inner `Stat` at a different `size`
  keeps its own size, not the outer one's (tested, mirroring `EmptyState`'s identical check).
- [x] Consumed-atom defect handling — none surfaced; `Icon`, `Text`, and `VisuallyHidden` were used exactly as their own Finalized reviews left
  them, no workaround needed inside `Stat`.

## Feature completeness

- Label, value, trend (with a direction, a colour, and a `goodDirection` for metrics where less is better), an icon badge, and supporting
  description text — the full set the inventory's own one-line description names ("Metric + label + trend indicator"), plus the surface
  (`variant`), colour accent (`tone`), density (`size`), and layout (`orientation`) axes every comparable molecule in this system already has.
  `announce` covers the live-dashboard case a static metric display wouldn't need but a real one commonly does.
- Required/recommended props sensibly defaulted: every prop but `Stat.Value`'s and `Stat.Trend`'s own required `children`/`value` has a default;
  nothing is required to render *something* reasonable (an empty `Stat` with no children renders a bare, empty box, matching `EmptyState`'s and
  `Card`'s own "every part optional" philosophy).
- Variant names (`ghost`/`outlined`/`filled`) and the tone/size scales are drawn from the existing shared vocabulary (`05` §2), not coined —
  checked against `Card`'s and `EmptyState`'s own unions before naming.

## Accessibility — verified, not assumed

- [x] ARIA correct for the actual role: `Stat` itself adds none (static content); `Stat.Icon` is `aria-hidden` unless given a `label`;
  `Stat.Trend` is `role="img"` with an `aria-label` that states the direction in words and always contains the same formatted text shown on
  screen (WCAG 2.5.3), confirmed for the default formatter and for a custom `formatNumber`/`labels` override.
- [x] Keyboard navigation — not applicable; nothing here is focusable or interactive.
- [x] jest-axe clean: the default composition, an announcing status region, a labelled region, every variant, both orientations, every tone.
  **Real finding, fixed the same pass, not a later follow-up:** the very first version had `aria-label` directly on `Stat.Trend`'s plain
  `<span>` with no role — axe's `aria-prohibited-attr` failed immediately (a `<span>` has no role that permits `aria-label`); fixed by adding
  `role="img"`, verified clean afterward.
- [x] Any new colour pairing — none. `Stat.Trend`'s success/danger/secondary text and icon colours, and the tone badge's colours, are all
  already-verified tokens (`03-token-system-spec.md`), reused as-is.
- [x] Cross-part ARIA/id wiring — `Stat` doesn't automatically wire `Stat.Label` to the root; unlike `FormField`'s exact shape (a label naming
  a single control), a stat's own label and value are read in plain DOM order by a linear screen-reader pass with nothing to mismatch, and the
  root's own `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` escape hatches (mirroring `EmptyState`'s) cover the case where an explicit region name is wanted.
- [x] Composed tab order — not applicable; nothing here is in the tab order at all.
- [x] Responsive/measured collapse never removing a focused control — not applicable; nothing here is ever removed based on available space.
- [x] Live region announces a change, never a first appearance — the actual design decision documented above (`Pagination`'s pattern, not
  `EmptyState`'s), verified by a dedicated test: the very first value shown produces an empty status region even after the announce delay
  elapses, and only a later, different value triggers a real announcement.
- [x] Every interactive target at least 24×24px — not applicable; nothing here is interactive.
- [x] A list with markers removed states `role="list"`/`role="listitem"` — not applicable; `Stat` renders no list.

## Responsiveness

- [x] Correct across the breakpoint scale — a `Stat` tile has no breakpoint-specific behaviour of its own (unlike `Tabs`' overflow or
  `EmptyState`'s two-large-sizes padding step); it's sized entirely by its own `size` prop and the width its container gives it. Verified at
  narrow widths that `Stat.Value` doesn't wrap or overflow visibly in the demo grids' own narrowest realistic column.

## Design quality

- [x] Visual execution: a tinted icon badge, a muted label, a bold large value with `tabular-nums`, and a colour-and-icon-coded trend beside it
  — reads as a deliberate, premium metric display, not a generic default. Entirely within the existing token set; no new token needed.
- [x] Text that changes never resizes neighbouring content — `Stat.Value`'s `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` keeps each digit a fixed
  width, confirmed live: the announce demo's value changes from `12,480` to `12,716` (same digit count) and separately would keep the trend's
  own position stable across a digit-count change too, since the number itself doesn't reflow character-by-character.
- [x] **Real defect, found only by looking at a live screenshot, not by any measurement-based test:** `Stat.Value`'s shared `overflow-wrap:
  anywhere` rule (copied from `EmptyState`'s title/description, which are prose) broke `"12,480"` across two lines as `"12,48"`/`"0"` in a
  narrow demo grid column — a measurement-based test couldn't have caught this, since the geometry was exactly as specified, it just specified
  the wrong thing for a number. Fixed by removing `overflow-wrap`/wrapping from `.value` entirely: a metric now overflows its container rather
  than breaking mid-digit, and the demo grid was confirmed clean afterward at a realistic (wider) viewport, where the original narrow reading
  was actually just the browser pane's own width, not a real defect at typical screen sizes.
- [x] Micro-interactions — none needed; a stat is inert display content, matching `Divider`'s own "not every component needs one."
- [x] Performance — no memoization needed (cheap render, no expensive computation); tree-shaking intact (no barrel re-exports); CSS uses no
  layout-triggering transitions.
- [x] Scalability — composition over configuration: five named sub-parts rather than one component with a long flag list, the same shape
  `Card`/`EmptyState` already use for a comparable amount of optional content.

## Theming

- [x] Confirmed working in both light and dark mode and both brand themes (Purple/Emerald) — verified live via the Storybook toolbar toggles,
  not inferred: the icon badge's tint, the trend's success/danger/secondary colours, and the outlined/filled surfaces all read correctly in a
  dark, `emerald-dark`-themed canvas (screenshotted).

## Storybook documentation

- [x] Docs page (`Stat.mdx`) follows the full section template (`07-storybook-and-documentation-standards.md` §4): Intro, Playground,
  Properties (root plus one subsection per sub-part, via a hidden docs-only stories file per ADR-0013), Variants/states gallery, Usage
  guidelines, Best practices, Accessibility, Code examples, Design tokens used, Related components.
- [x] Properties section's native-attribute disclaimer sentence is worded per element (`<div>` for the root/icon, `<p>` for
  label/value/description, `<span>` for trend) rather than one fixed phrasing.
- [x] Code examples include a genuine native prop in use (`title`/`onMouseEnter` on the root, matching the disclaimer's own named examples).
- [x] "Design tokens used" table checked by hand against `Stat.module.css` and the atoms it composes (Icon's tone classes, Text's colour
  props) — no automated `*.docs.test.ts` guard yet (that convention started with `CodeBlock`, 2026-09-26, and hasn't been backfilled onto every
  earlier component; a fair candidate for that backfill pass, not done here).
- [x] Properties table prop order set via each `PropertiesTable`'s own `order` array, not left to docgen's default.
- [x] Playground story exists, first after Intro, every prop live (`variant`, `tone`, `size`, `orientation`, `announce`, plus a
  Storybook-only `trend` toggle for the demo).
- [x] Every visible story's "Show code" is a hand-written, pasteable snippet from `Stat.snippets.ts`, typechecked by the generic
  `import.meta.glob`-based mechanism in `storySnippets.test.ts` (no per-component registration needed for the static snippets — only the
  Playground's dynamic snippet-builder function, `statPlaygroundSnippet`, needed its own explicit tests, mirroring every other component's
  Playground snippet function).
- [x] Every prop's Storybook control is genuinely interactive; every story's Controls panel actually drives its canvas (checked live, not
  assumed from the code) — confirmed for the Playground and every fixed-render gallery story's own args.
- [x] Sidebar `title` (`Molecules/Data Display/Stat`) matches the category taxonomy.

## Real defects found while building (each has a test that fails without the fix)

1. **`aria-label` on `Stat.Trend`'s plain `<span>` is invalid ARIA.** No role permits `aria-label` on a bare `<span>`; jest-axe's
   `aria-prohibited-attr` failed immediately. **Fix:** `role="img"`, the same technique `Avatar` already uses for a composite visual with no
   other applicable role. Every accessibility test now passes, including a dedicated `toHaveAccessibleName` assertion per direction.
2. **The announced text for a value with a trend read the trend's own text twice.** `Stat.Trend` usually nests inside `Stat.Value`, so its
   formatted number is already part of the value's own `textContent` — announcing both the value's raw text and the trend's separate
   accessible label read `"13,188+1.9, Increased by +1.9"` in a real browser (found by clicking the live-update demo's own button and reading
   the status region, not by unit test — the unit tests at the time didn't have a trend nested inside the announced value). **Fix:** read each
   `Stat.Value`'s own text from a clone with any nested `[data-stat-trend-label]` element removed first, then append that label once,
   separately. A new unit test (`"does not read the trend's own text twice..."`) locks in the correct, de-duplicated phrasing and asserts each
   piece of text appears exactly once.
3. **`Stat.Value`'s digits broke across two lines in a narrow grid column.** See "Design quality" above — `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, appropriate
   for prose (`EmptyState`'s title/description), was wrong for a number. **Fix:** removed from `.value`; it neither wraps nor breaks now.

## Functional verification

- [x] Component functions correctly end to end — exercised live in a real browser (Playground, every gallery story, the live-update demo's
  actual click), not just read.
- [x] What jsdom can't evaluate tested in a real browser: the CSS Grid `horizontal` orientation (the icon spanning every row of the content
  column, confirmed via screenshot, not just that the grid classes were applied); the announce timing (filled ~300ms after a real click, not
  immediately and not still empty after it — confirmed by direct DOM inspection in the live page, catching defect 2 above); dark mode and the
  Emerald brand theme's computed colours.
- [x] Measured the content, not just the box around it — `Stat.Trend`'s baseline alignment against `Stat.Value`'s own number was checked by
  eye against a real screenshot (the value and the trend sit on a shared visual baseline), not inferred from the CSS declaration alone; the
  digit-wrap defect (finding 3) was itself only caught this way, exactly the "measure the content, don't trust a check that has never failed"
  rule (`06-engineering-standards.md` §9) — the geometry-only check (nothing here asserts pixel positions) would never have caught a bad
  line-break decision inside the text itself, only a screenshot could.
- [x] Unit tests (61) cover rendering, every prop, `Stat.Trend`'s direction/sentiment/`goodDirection`/`formatNumber`/`labels` logic, `announce`
  timing (including StrictMode), standard prop passthrough on every part, and jest-axe. Real-browser tests (17, across `Stat.stories.tsx` and
  the five sub-part docs-only story files) cover the same Playground/gallery/live-update surface a real reader would actually click through.
- [x] Self-verified before reporting done: `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint --max-warnings 0`, the full package's unit suite (4525 passing) and
  real-browser Storybook suite (853 passing), a production `build`, and the component bundle-size check (`Stat`: 2.63KB JS / 1.26KB CSS,
  comfortably within budget) — all re-run clean after every fix above, not just once at the start.

## Gaps named, not built

Left out deliberately; each can be added without breaking the current API:

- **A sparkline or mini-chart inside `Stat`.** A real, concrete feature some comparable dashboard components include, but it's a genuinely
  separate rendering concern (likely its own small chart primitive) rather than a natural extension of this component's own five sub-parts —
  worth a dedicated look once there's a real need, not sketched in speculatively here.
- **A `StatGroup`/grid wrapper.** The Docs page's "Several, side by side" example uses a plain CSS grid (or the existing `Grid` molecule) —
  deliberately not a new dedicated wrapper component, since nothing about laying out several `Stat`s together needs behaviour beyond what
  `Grid` (or a bare CSS grid) already provides.
- **A loading/skeleton state.** `Skeleton` already exists as its own atom and composes naturally in `Stat.Value`'s place while data is
  loading; a dedicated `loading` prop on `Stat` itself would just be a thin, unnecessary wrapper around that composition.

## Follow-up (2026-09-27, at explicit direction) — label size, orientation restructured, tone-aware variants

Four requested changes, asked about first where the request left real ambiguity (`AskUserQuestion`, twice — once for four API-shape questions,
once more for what happens to the icon badge specifically once its own visual treatment was clearly going to change), then built:

1. **`Stat.Label` three size steps larger.** `xs→md, sm→lg, md→lg, lg→xl, xl→xl` (was `xs→xs, sm→sm, md→sm, lg→base, xl→base`). Split into its
   own `labelSize` table, separate from a new `descriptionSize` table holding the *old* values — `Stat.Description` was never asked to change,
   and the two had only ever coincidentally shared one table, not a reason to move together.
2. **`orientation` no longer means "the icon sits beside everything."** It now means "the icon and `Stat.Label` are paired into one row instead
   of stacking" — nothing else about the layout changes. This replaces the two-column CSS grid the original build used (icon spanning every row
   of a second column) entirely; `Stat`'s root is now a single flex column in both orientations. `Stat.tsx` finds `Stat.Icon`/`Stat.Label`
   among `children` (`Children.toArray` + `isValidElement` + a type check — the same pattern `Stack` already uses for inserting a divider
   between items) and moves the pair, icon first, ahead of everything else, regardless of the order they were written in or what sits between
   them — asked and confirmed, rather than assumed, including that this needed no new prop or sub-component for the caller to write.
3. **The icon matches `Stat.Label`'s own font size in the paired row, dropping its circular badge entirely.** Asked and confirmed
   specifically: keeping a badge and just shrinking it (a small tinted dot) was the explicit alternative rejected. The row's own `font-size` is
   set inline from the exact value driving `Stat.Label`'s size (`var(--dbm-font-size-${labelSize[size]})`) — not a second, parallel table in
   CSS that could drift from the one in `Stat.tsx` — and the icon (and its now-transparent, unpadded badge box) is sized `1em` against it in
   `Stat.module.css`, so the two can never disagree. The icon's own colour there is deliberately `--stat-icon-subtle-color` (the same value a
   plain ghost/outlined badge already uses), not whatever `--stat-badge-color` happens to be — `filled`'s own solid-fill treatment doesn't
   apply once there's no fill left to read against.
4. **Every variant now colours `Stat.Icon` and `Stat.Label` by `tone`, not just the icon badge.** `ghost`/`outlined` tint the badge and colour
   the label the same way they already tinted the badge; `outlined` additionally tints its border (`border.{tone}-subtle`, a decorative accent
   like every other `*-subtle` border in this system, not bound by the 3:1 floor); `filled` tints the *whole stat* (`bg.{tone}-subtle`, in
   place of the previous unconditional `bg.neutral-subtle`) and turns the badge into a *solid* fill (`bg.{tone}`) read against with the matching
   `icon.on-{tone}` token, rather than the light one the other two variants use — the same solid/on-tone pairing `Alert.Action` already
   established. `neutral` (no tone class rendered) keeps every one of today's existing defaults exactly — checked, not assumed, since it's the
   only tone with no dedicated CSS class to layer these onto. No new token: every value reused is already contrast-verified in
   `03-token-system-spec.md`.

**A real defect, caught only by measuring computed style live, not by any of the new unit tests:** the first version of `filled`'s own
per-tone rule set the badge's solid fill and its `icon.on-{tone}` colour, but never the *whole stat's* own light fill — `--stat-bg` stayed
`bg.neutral-subtle` regardless of `tone`. `filled`+`tone="danger"` read `rgb(250, 250, 251)` (`bg.neutral-subtle`, a near-white grey) where
`bg.danger-subtle` (a visibly pink tint) was expected — invisible in a screenshot at normal viewing size, caught by reading the actual computed
`backgroundColor` in the browser and comparing it against the intended token, the same way the announce-text duplication defect was caught in
the original build. Fixed by adding the missing `--stat-bg` line to each of the five `.filled.toneX` rules; a new real-browser regression test
(`ToneAcrossVariantsInteraction`) now asserts every one of the nine colour values this follow-up touches (badge fill/colour, label colour,
border colour, and the whole stat's own fill, across `ghost`/`outlined`/`filled`) against the literal token it should resolve to, not just that
a CSS class was applied — confirmed to actually fail without the fix before confirming it passes with it.

**`Stat.Label`'s own colour no longer comes from `Text`'s `color` prop at all** (previously hardcoded to `"tertiary"`) — a same-specificity
class from `Text`'s own default would otherwise win or lose against this file's own override depending on build/file order alone, the exact
fragile case `05-component-api-conventions.md`'s "spread props before computed attributes" rule warns about one level up the stack from. Fixed
with `p.label { color: var(--stat-label-color) }` — the extra element-type selector gives it reliably higher specificity than any single
`Text`-applied colour class, regardless of order.

Re-verified: `tsc`, `eslint`, the whole package's unit suite (4534 passing, +9 new/updated) and real-browser suite (855 passing, +1 new), a
production `build`, the bundle-size check (`Stat`: 2.82KB JS / 1.36KB CSS), and a live check of every gallery story (Playground, Orientation,
Tones, the new Tone-across-variants gallery) in both light and dark mode.

## Follow-up (2026-09-27, at explicit direction, same day) — label size pulled back down, uppercase by default

Two more requested changes, on top of the follow-up above:

1. **`Stat.Label` pulled back down one size step.** `xs→base, sm→md, md→md, lg→lg, xl→lg` (was `xs→md, sm→lg, md→lg, lg→xl, xl→xl` from
   the follow-up above — net two steps up from `Stat.Description`'s table now, not three). Applies identically in both orientations, since
   `labelSize` is the one table both read from. The icon in `orientation="horizontal"` needed no separate change: it was already sized `1em`
   against the row's own inline `font-size`, itself set from this same `labelSize` lookup, so it shrinks with the label automatically —
   confirmed live rather than assumed, since "the icon should follow" was the explicit ask.
2. **`Stat.Label` is uppercase by default.** A CSS default (`text-transform: uppercase` on `p.label` in `Stat.module.css`), not a new prop —
   asked for specifically ("developers can override the style if they want using style prop"), so the override path is `Stat.Label`'s
   existing `style` prop (e.g. `style={{ textTransform: "none" }}`), which as an inline style always wins over a class regardless of order,
   the same reasoning already applied to `p.label`'s own colour rule above. No new prop, no new token.

While touching this area, corrected several sentences in `Stat.mdx` left stale by the *first* 2026-09-27 follow-up above (tone colouring
`Stat.Label` too, not just `Stat.Icon`) — the intro copy, `Stat.Label`'s own properties-table description, and two Accessibility-tab bullets
still said `tone` "only tints the icon badge," contradicting the "All tones"/"Tone across variants" sections a few screens below in the same
file. Left the token-row list (`## Tokens`) as found — it's missing rows for `text.{tone}`, `border.{tone}-subtle`, the solid `bg.{tone}`/
`icon.on-{tone}` pair, and `bg.neutral`, all real tokens this component uses since the tone-aware-variants follow-up — a real gap, but a
separate, larger audit (verifying each one measured in all four themes, this system's own bar for a token row) than this two-item request
justified opening up; flagged here rather than fixed inline or silently left unmentioned.

Re-verified: `tsc`, `eslint`, the whole package's unit suite (4536 passing, +2 new: the uppercase default and its `style`-prop override), the
whole package's real-browser suite (855 passing, unchanged — no new interaction test was needed, since the existing
`ToneAcrossVariantsInteraction` computed-style assertions don't pin an exact label font size), a production `build`, and a live check of the
Orientation, Tone-across-variants and Docs pages in both light and dark mode.

## Not verified

No real screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS) was run against it; `Stat.Trend`'s `role="img"` announcement and `announce`'s own status region
were checked through the accessibility tree and axe, and by reading the live DOM after a real click, not by listening to actual screen-reader
output. Right-to-left rendering was not separately checked with a real-browser test — `Stat` uses only logical CSS properties throughout (no
physical `left`/`right`), so it's expected to mirror correctly, but that expectation hasn't been confirmed the way `Tabs`' own RTL behaviour was.
