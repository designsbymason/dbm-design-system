# Select

**Tier:** Molecule · **Category:** Inputs & Forms · **Finalized:** Not yet — pending user confirmation

## Review pass (2026-09-13)

Full `06-engineering-standards.md` §9 pass — first review for this component, the third
molecule-tier review overall (after `Grid`, `List`), and the first molecule review where the
compound-component and Radix-primitive checkpoints apply for real — `Grid`/`List` have neither a
dot-notation sub-export nor a wrapped Radix compound primitive; `Select` (`Select.Option`, built on
`@radix-ui/react-select`) has both. Findings, in the order fixed (Playground-missing first,
Docs-page-missing last, per the standing reporting convention):

1. **Playground story added, and every other story rewired to genuinely use its own args.**
   `Select.stories.tsx` had 6 stories, only one real `argType` (`size`), and 5 of 6 stories used an
   args-free `render: () => (...)` — the same "story ignores its own args" bug class both `Grid`'s
   and `List`'s reviews already found and fixed. Added a full interactive Playground plus real
   `argTypes` for all 27 props, and rewired every story to genuinely share `{...args}`, disabling
   only each story's own deliberate varying axis (`size` in `AllSizes`, `hasError`/`disabled` in
   `States` — both the multi-instance-gallery exception). Also added two new stories to actually
   demonstrate findings 5/6 below: `SideAndAlign` and `CustomTrigger`.

2. **Real, confirmed accessibility bug: `{...triggerProps}` was spread *after* the computed
   `aria-invalid`.** `Select.tsx`'s trigger render spread `{...triggerProps}` as the last JSX
   attribute, following `aria-invalid={hasError || undefined}`. `aria-invalid` isn't excluded from
   `SelectProps`' own native-attribute passthrough, so a consumer could pass their own
   `aria-invalid` — which silently won over `hasError`'s own computed value. Same recurring
   ordering bug class as `List`'s own finding #2 (Button/Skeleton/ProgressBar/FieldError/List).
   Fixed by reordering so `{...triggerProps}` comes first; applied the identical fix to
   `Select.Option`'s own `{...props}` spread too, even though no live bug was found there yet — the
   same class of risk exists the moment any computed attribute is added to that sub-part later.
   Added a regression test verifying a consumer-supplied `aria-invalid` no longer overrides the
   computed one.

3. **`id`/`style`/`data-testid`/`aria-label`/`aria-labelledby`/`aria-describedby` weren't explicitly
   redeclared in `SelectProps`.** Worked today only via the implicit `extends
   Omit<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"button">, ...>` inheritance — confirmed this isn't automatically
   covered by checking `Input.types.ts` (the closest atom precedent, identical `interface X extends
   Y` shape), which explicitly redeclares all six regardless. Fixed by redeclaring all six with
   matching JSDoc wording.

4. **Real, more significant compound sub-part gap: `Select.Option` (`SelectOptionProps`) extended
   no native element type at all.** Unlike `SelectRoot`, an option couldn't accept `id`, `style`,
   `data-testid`, or *any* other native/aria passthrough — not even a bare `title` attribute. This
   is exactly what the "compound-component sub-part completeness" checkpoint (added ahead of the
   molecule review phase, never yet exercised — `Grid`/`List` have no sub-parts) exists to catch.
   Fixed by extending `Omit<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"div">, ...>` and explicitly redeclaring
   `id`/`className`/`style`/`data-testid` with their own JSDoc, matching `SelectRoot`'s own
   convention. Also added: JSDoc on `children` (previously undocumented), and Radix `Item`'s own
   `textValue` prop (needed for correct typeahead search once an option's visible content isn't
   plain searchable text) — wired through and covered by a live keyboard-typeahead test.

5. **Radix-primitive prop audit: `side`/`align` (dropdown positioning) weren't exposed**, hardcoded
   to `position="popper"` only. `Tooltip` (already Finalized, the closest Radix-popover precedent in
   this codebase) explicitly exposes exactly these two as real, documented props on an identical
   `SelectSide`/`SelectAlign` type shape — establishing they're "commonly relevant" here too, not
   scope creep. Added both, wired to `SelectPrimitive.Content`, demonstrated in the new
   `SideAndAlign` story and verified live (a `side="right"` selection genuinely opened the dropdown
   to the trigger's right, not below it).

6. **`asChild` support added, with a real architectural conflict resolved deliberately, not
   guessed.** `Select`'s own `children` prop is already `<Select.Option>`s for the dropdown — Radix
   `Slot` needs exactly one child to merge the trigger's behavior onto, and the trigger's own
   built-in content (`Select.Value` + the caret `Icon`) is hardcoded internally, neither of which
   `Button`'s own `asChild` precedent (where `children` *is* the button's own visible content, no
   competing use) directly resolves. Asked for a decision rather than guessing an API shape that
   might need a breaking change later: added a dedicated `trigger?: ReactElement` prop (matching
   `Tooltip`'s own single-`ReactElement` trigger shape, just under its own name here since
   `children` was already spoken for) — when `asChild` is set, `trigger` becomes the `Slot`'s single
   child, fully replacing the built-in value/caret display, mirroring `Button`'s own "asChild
   replaces the icon/label content" precedent exactly. Three dev-mode warnings added, matching
   `Button`'s own validation style: `trigger` without `asChild`, `asChild` without `trigger`, and
   `placeholder` alongside `asChild` (inert — no `Select.Value` renders in that mode). Confirmed
   live: a real `<a>`/`<button>` passed as `trigger` renders as the actual DOM element (not wrapped
   in an extra node), still opens the real dropdown, and still receives `Select`'s own
   size/error/className chrome via Radix `Slot`'s built-in prop-merging.

7. **Docs page added** (`Select.mdx`), full 10-section template. Live-verified: Playground and all
   8 variant stories render correctly, including the `side`/`align` placement fix and the custom
   `asChild` trigger; Properties table renders all 27 props in the declared order with real
   descriptions and correct value-option pills; both `RelatedCard`s (`Input`, `FieldLabel`) render
   live previews with correct `/?path=/docs/...` `href`s. **Caught and fixed while drafting, not
   after:** an early draft referenced `FormField` (as the typical container for `Select` +
   `aria-describedby` wiring) both in `Select.mdx`'s own prose and in `Select.types.ts`'s own
   `aria-describedby` JSDoc — `FormField` doesn't exist yet (still an unbuilt molecule per
   `04-component-inventory.md`). Fixed by rewriting both to match `Input.types.ts`'s own real,
   already-shipped `aria-describedby` wording, and swapping the second `RelatedCard` to the
   already-built `FieldLabel` instead. Both brand themes × both modes spot-checked live
   (Purple/Light, Emerald/Dark) — correct contrast, dropdown and options both themed correctly, no
   console errors.

## Verification

`pnpm lint` (eslint + full `tsc --noEmit` + `typecheck:storybook`, clean), full `vitest` unit suite
(1095/1095 passing package-wide, 24/24 for `Select` itself, up from 13), the `storybook` Vitest
project (381/381 passing package-wide, up from 378), `tsup` build (clean), `check-component-
bundle-size` (`Select`: 1.56KB JS / 0.92KB CSS gzipped, within budget). Live-verified in Storybook:
every prop's control genuinely drives its own story's canvas; the `aria-invalid` override fix
re-verified via a real consumer-supplied `aria-invalid={false}` no longer winning over `hasError`;
`side="right"` genuinely repositioned the dropdown; the custom `asChild` trigger opens the real
dropdown and receives Select's own chrome; 0 accessibility violations closed, open, and with a
custom `asChild` trigger; both brand themes × both modes confirmed live.

**Checked and passing, no action needed:** TypeScript strict/no `any`, zero hardcoded values (the
one non-token `box-shadow` variant selector is an already-established, deliberate pattern — shadows
aren't reactive semantic tokens, matches precedent elsewhere in this codebase), SSR-safe (`useId`),
original DBM implementation, solid existing baseline test coverage before this review (13 tests,
including open/closed axe checks), atom-reuse of `Icon` with no defect found in it, controlled/
uncontrolled pairs already correct for both `value`/`defaultValue` and `open`/`defaultOpen`,
composed tab order not applicable in the way `GridItem`'s stepper example was (Radix's own
roving-focus/typeahead mechanism inside the open dropdown is a standard, already-accessible pattern,
not a DBM-composed tab-order decision to verify by hand), cross-part ARIA/id wiring not applicable
(`Select` doesn't compose a label/helper-text triad itself — that's a future `FormField`'s job).
Grouped options (`Select.Group`/`Select.Label`) remain a deliberate, already-JSDoc'd deferral
("leaves room for grouped options later without a breaking API change") — re-affirmed during this
review, not a fresh finding, and now also noted in the Docs page's own "Best practices" section for
visibility.

## Post-review fix (2026-09-14, user-reported): control-panel wiring, values, and order

**Request: verify Select's Storybook controls show each story's real value instead of "Choose
option..."; fix props showing an inert "Set string" placeholder instead of a real input; make sure
prop order makes sense in both the stories and the Docs page Properties table; and disable any
control that isn't genuinely interactive for a given story.**

**`name`/`form`/`autoComplete` showing an inert "Set string" placeholder button.** Same root cause
as `List`'s own `start` prop fix: a `text` control with an `undefined` starting arg renders as a
placeholder button, not an empty-but-editable input. Fixed by giving all three a real `""` starting
arg, matching `GridItem.stories.tsx`'s own established `parseNumberArg`-adjacent convention (a
`text` control gates on `undefined` exactly like a `number` control does).

**`dir` showing "Choose option..." though it has a real, standard resolved value.** Same "control
must match what's genuinely in effect" reasoning as `List`'s own `as`/`marker` fix — `dir` has no
destructuring-level default in `Select.tsx` (passed straight through to Radix `Root`), but its real
effective value when omitted is `'ltr'`. Fixed by setting it as the Playground's starting arg.
`defaultValue`/`value`/`placeholder` were audited too and correctly left alone — their true default
genuinely *is* "nothing selected," which the canvas already shows consistently as a placeholder; a
forced fake selection there would misrepresent real default behavior, not fix a bug.

**Real, confirmed control/canvas mismatch bugs — the same class as `List`'s own `as`/`marker`
finding, found by checking every story individually, not just the Playground.** `AllSizes`' own
`defaultValue: "md"` was genuinely applied and visibly showing "Medium" in all five instances, while
the shared control read "Choose option..." — root-caused to the `defaultValue` argType's `options`
list being hardcoded to the Playground's own 5-variant demo set, which doesn't include `"md"` at
all (a completely different value space from `AllSizes`' own `sm`/`md`/`lg` children). The same
options-list mismatch existed for `States` (children: `primary` only), `DisabledOption` (`primary`/
`secondary`/`tertiary`), and `LongList` (30 country names) — none of which share the Playground's
option set. Fixed per-story: `AllSizes`/`States`/`LongList` disable `defaultValue`'s control
(fixed/structural demo content, not the story's own point, and/or impractical to explore);
`DisabledOption` instead overrides `defaultValue`'s own `options` to its real three values, kept
live since trying `defaultValue="secondary"` (the disabled option) is a genuinely interesting,
real thing to explore there — confirmed live that Radix correctly declines to pre-select a disabled
option via `defaultValue`, real component behavior, not a bug.

**`Controlled` story's render ignored its own args entirely** — a bare hardcoded `<Select>` with no
`{...args}` spread, so every one of its 27 controls was a silent no-op (confirmed live: toggling
`disabled` did nothing). The same "story ignores its own args" bug class `Grid`'s and `List`'s own
reviews already found and fixed elsewhere in this codebase. Fixed by spreading `{...args}`, with
`value`/`onValueChange` still driven by this story's own local state (its whole point) and
`defaultValue` explicitly disabled (passing both `value` and `defaultValue` at once is the exact
controlled/uncontrolled conflict `Select.mdx`'s own "Don't" list already warns against). Re-verified
live: toggling `disabled` now genuinely dims the trigger.

**Real, non-obvious ordering bug, root-caused rather than patched around:** the *native* per-story
Controls panel (Storybook's own addon tab, distinct from the Docs page's own custom
`PlaygroundControls` block) consistently floated `disabled` to the very first position, ahead of
`value` — while every other prop matched the intended `SelectProps` declaration order exactly, and
the Docs page's own explicitly-`order`-controlled blocks were already 100% correct throughout.
Confirmed via direct comparison against `Input` (an atom with the identical `interface X extends
Omit<ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"button">, ...>` shape, including its own explicit `disabled`
redeclaration) that this isn't a general limitation of that pattern — `Input`'s own native panel
orders `disabled` correctly. The one structural difference: `Select` is `Object.assign(SelectRoot,
{ Option: SelectOption })` — the first compound, dot-notation component this codebase has reviewed
(`Grid`/`List` have no sub-parts) — and TypeScript infers the *bare* `Object.assign(...)` call's
return type as an unnamed intersection, which the docgen tool apparently resolves less predictably
than a plain `forwardRef` export. Fixed by introducing an explicit `SelectComponent` type alias and
annotating the export with it (`export const Select: SelectComponent = Object.assign(...)`) instead
of relying on the inferred type — confirmed live: `disabled` immediately moved to its correct
position, with no other change to the component's runtime behavior. Worth carrying forward as a
convention for any future dot-notation compound component in this codebase.

**Re-verified live across every story, not assumed from the diff:** `Playground`'s `dir`/`name`/
`form`/`autoComplete` all show correct real values in the native panel; `AllSizes`/`States`/
`LongList` show `defaultValue` as `-`; `DisabledOption`'s own options list correctly restricted to
its three real children; `Controlled`'s `disabled` toggle genuinely dims the canvas; `disabled`
correctly ordered (right after `hasError`) on every story checked. Full suite re-run clean: `pnpm
lint`, `vitest` unit (24/24 for `Select`) and `storybook` project (381/381) tests, `tsup` build,
`check-component-bundle-size` (unchanged, within budget).

## Post-review fix #2 (2026-09-14, user-reported, with a screenshot): dropdown never actually scrolled

**"select 'long list...' story seems incorrect. Shouldn't the dropdown be a short height that
vertically scrollable?"** Confirmed real, and — unlike the earlier Storybook-controls-only fix
round — a genuine defect in the shipped component's own CSS, not a demo issue. `Select.module.css`'s
`.content` rule had no `max-height` at all, so the dropdown rendered every option fully unclipped
regardless of how many there were; Radix's own `ScrollUpButton`/`ScrollDownButton`/`Viewport`
scrolling mechanism only activates once `Content` is actually height-constrained, and without that
constraint it never had anything to do. The "Long list (scroll buttons)" story's own name had been
describing behavior that was never actually happening.

Fixed by adding `max-height: var(--radix-select-content-available-height)` to `.content` — Radix's
own documented pattern for this exact case, not a value this component invents: a real CSS custom
property Radix sets at runtime to the actual remaining viewport space. Re-verified live, not assumed
from the CSS alone: the dropdown now opens to a short panel (Argentina–Egypt) with a visible
scroll-down affordance; scrolling reaches United States (the real last item) with the scroll-up
affordance now showing instead. Short lists (`Default`, 5 options) confirmed unaffected — no scroll
buttons appear, nothing changed there, since those never approach the available-height budget. Both
brand themes × both modes reconfirmed live on the fixed dropdown (Emerald/Dark screenshotted). 0
accessibility violations re-confirmed. Full suite re-run clean: `pnpm lint`, `vitest` unit (24/24)
and `storybook` project (381/381) tests.

## Post-review fix #3 (2026-09-14, user-requested): `CustomTrigger` story uses DBM's own `Button`

**"could you use dbm button instead?"** (of the story's plain `<button type="button">`), followed by
**"update 'asChild + trigger' button variant to primary. make sure its default and not full width
.... in other words it should hug content. Also, change label from 'Open the custom trigger ▾' to
'Open the custom trigger'"**. `CustomTrigger`'s own point is demonstrating that `asChild`/`trigger`
accepts *any* real element and correctly merges Select's chrome onto it via Radix `Slot` — swapping
the plain `<button>` for this system's own `Button` atom makes that concrete rather than abstract,
and is a more realistic real-world usage example besides.

Swapped to `<Button variant="primary">`, removed the label's manual `▾` (redundant now that `Button`
is the real, recognizable atom, not a placeholder). **Real cross-component interaction found and
fixed along the way:** `Select.module.css`'s `.trigger` class sets `width: 100%` by design (see
finding 1's own file header comment) — Radix `Slot` merges that class onto whatever element is
slotted as `trigger`, which silently overrode `Button`'s own `fullWidth={false}` default and stretched
it edge-to-edge, contrary to `Button`'s own real default behavior everywhere else in this codebase.
Fixed with an inline `style={{ width: "fit-content" }}` on the `Button` itself — inline styles always
beat an external stylesheet class regardless of merge order, so this reliably wins without touching
`Select.module.css`'s own `100%` rule (still correct for the built-in trigger). Confirmed live: the
button now hugs its own label content instead of stretching full width.

## Diagnostic (2026-09-14, user-reported, with a screenshot): `side="right"` dropdown appearing behind the control panel

**"I'm noticing the dropdown appears behind the control panel, for instance when the side is set to
'right'. is this storybook issue or component bug?"** Investigated via precise DOM/iframe coordinate
measurement (`getBoundingClientRect()` on the dropdown vs. the Storybook canvas iframe's own rect,
correctly offset into page-space rather than compared directly — an iframe-inner element's rect is
relative to the iframe's own viewport, not the outer page). **Concluded: a Storybook-layout artifact,
not a component defect.** The addon panel docks on the right by default, leaving a narrow canvas;
combined with the trigger's own full-width-by-design `.trigger` class (see finding 1), there is
genuinely no room on either side of the trigger for the ~244px-wide dropdown when `side="right"` is
requested in that narrow context. Confirmed by testing `side="bottom"` in the identical narrow
canvas — it positioned perfectly, and Radix's own collision detection (which measures
`window.innerWidth` from inside the iframe, matching its real rendered width) correctly perceived the
narrow viewport and repositioned accordingly rather than malfunctioning. No code change made — purely
diagnostic. Offered the user a documentation caveat about `side="left"`/`"right"` needing adequate
horizontal space; not yet requested.

## Post-review fix #4 (2026-09-14, user-requested): stories constrained and centered, not full-width

**"could you update the width of the select in the stories so that its not full width. also make
sure its centered within the canvas/demo box."** Every story's demo `<div>` had previously stretched
to the canvas's own full padded width, since `.trigger`'s `width: 100%` (finding 1) fills whatever
container it's given — matching the trigger's own real, deliberate default behavior, but making every
story visually stretch edge-to-edge in a way `Input.stories.tsx` (the closest sibling molecule,
already establishing a `maxWidth: "20rem"` demo-container convention) does not.

Added a shared `demoContainerStyle = { maxWidth: "20rem", marginInline: "auto" }` constant, matching
`Input.stories.tsx`'s own `20rem` value, and applied it to all 9 stories (`Playground`/meta-render,
`Default`, `AllSizes`, `States`, `DisabledOption`, `LongList`, `SideAndAlign`, `CustomTrigger`,
`Controlled`) — merged into each story's own existing wrapper (flex-column gap, `paddingBlock`, etc.)
rather than adding a redundant nested `<div>`. `CustomTrigger` needed one addition beyond the shared
style: since its `Button` trigger is `fit-content` (finding above), not `100%` width like every other
story's trigger, constraining only the outer container wasn't sufficient to center it — added
`display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"` to that story's own wrapper specifically.

Re-verified live in Storybook, not assumed from the diff: every story's canvas — both as its own
story view and embedded via `Select.mdx`'s own `<Canvas of={...}>` blocks on the Docs page — now
renders the select/button constrained to `20rem` and horizontally centered; `SideAndAlign`'s
`side="right"` dropdown re-confirmed still opening correctly in a normal (non-narrow) canvas after
the width change. `pnpm lint` clean; `vitest` unit (24/24 for `Select`) and `storybook` project
(381/381) suites re-run clean.

## Post-review fix #5 (2026-09-14, user-reported, with a screenshot): custom `Button` trigger not rendering as `primary`

**"what happen to our primary button as the custom trigger in select's 'asChild + Trigger' story? did
it revert back? fix it"** — the story's code genuinely still said `variant="primary"` (no revert), but
the rendered button showed white/outlined chrome instead. Root cause: `Select.tsx`'s trigger
`className` unconditionally applied `cx(styles.trigger, sizeClass[size], hasError && styles.error,
className)` regardless of `asChild`. Radix `Slot` merges that className onto the custom `trigger`
element by concatenation, so the rendered `Button` ended up with both its own `_variantPrimary_...`
class and Select's own `_trigger_...` class at once — and since both are equal-specificity
single-class CSS-Modules selectors, the winner came down to unpredictable stylesheet load order, not
intent. Confirmed live via computed styles: `Select.module.css`'s `.trigger` background-color/border/
color were winning over `Button`'s own `variantPrimary` rules (the earlier `width: "fit-content"`
inline-style fix from finding #3 only ever addressed `width`, not this).

Fixed by only applying Select's own built-in trigger chrome classes when *not* `asChild` — in
`asChild` mode, only the consumer's own `className` passthrough still applies, since the whole point
of a custom `trigger` is that it brings its own complete styling (unlike `Button`'s own `asChild`,
where merging its classes onto the child *is* the point — a different, non-transferable precedent).
Removed the now-unnecessary `style={{ width: "fit-content" }}` from the `CustomTrigger` story — with
`.trigger`'s `width: 100%` no longer applying in `asChild` mode, `Button`'s own `fullWidth={false}`
default already produces the right sizing with no override needed. Re-verified live: the button
renders fully purple/primary, still fit-content and centered, and still opens the real dropdown with
all five options. `pnpm lint` clean; `vitest` unit (24/24) and `storybook` project (381/381) suites
re-run clean.

## Post-review fix #6 (2026-09-14, user-requested): size variants didn't actually match Input's

**"update all Select component size variants to match to it's size counterpart in Input component,
eg. Select md size variant should be same size as the Input md size variant. do not change Input
component."** `Select.module.css`'s own "Sizes" comment had long claimed an "identical scale to
Input.module.css so a Select and an Input at the same `size` line up exactly in a shared row" — not
actually true. Two real gaps, found by directly diffing both files' size rules rather than trusting
the comment:

1. **`.trigger` had no `line-height` at all**, unlike `Input.module.css`'s own `.wrapper`, which sets
   `line-height: var(--dbm-line-height-tight)` explicitly — needed because a native interactive
   element doesn't inherit `line-height` from an ancestor the way a plain element does (same root
   cause `Input`'s own file documents for its `<input>`, just one level up here on the `<button>`
   trigger itself). Without it, `.trigger` fell back to the browser's own UA-default `line-height:
   normal`, not `tight`.
2. **Every `.sizeX`'s `padding-block` used its own shorter, ad hoc values** (`space-1`/`space-1`/
   `space-2`/`space-2`/`space-3` for xs/sm/md/lg/xl) instead of `Input`'s real formula — Button's own
   `padding-block` for the matching size, minus `--dbm-border-width-1` (both `Select`'s trigger and
   `Input`'s wrapper carry that same 1px border; Button, having none, doesn't subtract it). `font-size`
   and `padding-inline` already matched Input exactly per step — only `padding-block` was off, by
   6px of total height at every size except `lg` (14px there).

Fixed by adding the missing `line-height` and replacing each `padding-block` with `Input`'s own
formula (`calc(var(--dbm-space-N) - var(--dbm-border-width-1))`, same per-size `N` as Input: xs→2,
sm→3, md→3, lg→4, xl→4). Confirmed live, not assumed from the CSS: measured both components'
`AllSizes` stories via `getBoundingClientRect()` — Select's five trigger heights now equal Input's
five wrapper heights exactly (xs 29.8px, sm 39.3px, md 42.4px, lg 54.4px, xl 59.3px, matched at every
step), and both `AllSizes` galleries look visually identical box-height-wise side by side. `States`
(empty/filled/disabled/error) re-confirmed rendering correctly at the new heights. No change made to
`Input` itself, per the request. `pnpm lint` clean; `vitest` unit (`Select` 24/24, `Input` 25/25) and
`storybook` project (381/381) suites re-run clean.

## Final pre-finalization pass (2026-09-14, user-requested)

**"let's do a final review of the Select component before finalizing it."** Re-ran the full
`06-engineering-standards.md` §9 checklist against the component's current state (six post-review fix
rounds landed since the original pass), rather than assuming the original findings still fully cover
it. Found and fixed three real, concrete compliance gaps — no design decisions needed for any of
them:

1. **`Select.mdx`'s own "Design tokens used" section was incomplete** relative to what
   `Select.module.css` actually references — missing `border-width.1`/`border-width.2`,
   `font-family.primary`, `font-size.xs`–`font-size.lg`, `font-weight.semibold`, `line-height.tight`
   (added this session's own sizing fix), `opacity.40`, and `space.6` (the scroll buttons' own
   height) — noticeably thinner than `Input.mdx`'s own equivalent section for a component now
   explicitly sized to match it. Fixed by adding all seven, each with real usage descriptions.
2. **`trigger`/`size`/`hasError`'s own JSDoc didn't document that Select's own built-in trigger
   chrome doesn't apply in `asChild` mode** — a real behavior change from fix #5 above that a
   consumer reading only the types (not this file) would have no way to know. Fixed by adding a
   sentence to each of the three.
3. **No regression test covered fix #5's actual className-merge behavior** — existing tests covered
   `asChild` rendering the right element and warning correctly, but nothing asserted that Select's
   own built-in classes are absent from a custom trigger, or that the consumer's own `className` and
   the custom trigger's own `className` both still reach the DOM. Added two tests
   (`Select.test.tsx`, `24 → 26`) covering both.

**Also re-verified live, not re-derived from the diff**, since three CSS-affecting fixes (#5's
className logic, #6's `line-height`/`padding-block` sizing) landed since the original pass:
`AllSizes` and the `CustomTrigger` story confirmed correct in Emerald/Dark (the custom trigger's own
pale-mint `primary` color is `Button`'s own real, already-established dark-mode appearance, not a
Select-side regression); `Default` confirmed correct and fully functional (opens, selects) at a
375px mobile viewport, no overflow past its own `20rem` cap; full suite re-run clean — `pnpm lint`,
`vitest` unit (`Select` 26/26), `storybook` project (381/381), `tsup` build, `check-component-bundle-
size` (1.56KB JS / 0.97KB CSS gzipped, within budget — CSS grew ~0.05KB from fix #6's added
`line-height`/`calc()` rules).

**Two feature-completeness items surfaced for an explicit scope decision, not actioned without
one** (per §9's own scope-creep guardrail — every addition needs a named, concrete rationale, not
implemented speculatively):

- **`Select.Option` doesn't expose Radix `Item`'s own `asChild` prop**, unlike `Select` itself (which
  already got `asChild` in the original review, finding 6). Radix's `Select.Item` genuinely supports
  it — the concrete use case is rendering an option as a custom row component (e.g. with a leading
  icon or secondary description line) while keeping Radix's own listbox/typeahead/selection behavior.
  Not yet needed by anything in this codebase.
- **No "clear selection" affordance**, unlike `Input` — the same form-field family, sharing Select's
  own border/radius/focus/error/size chrome — which already has one (`onClear` + its own clear
  button). Once a value is selected, there's currently no way back to the placeholder/unselected
  state without a caller-provided blank option. A real, comparable-sibling gap, but a nontrivial one
  to add correctly (its own icon-size mapping per `size` step, keyboard/focus handling, RTL — the
  same shape of work `Input`'s own `onClear` already required).

Both left **unactioned pending the user's decision** — build now, defer explicitly (matching how
grouped options was already deferred in the original review), or decline.

## Post-review fix #7 (2026-09-14, user-requested): both surfaced findings built

**"let's do the 2 findings after the last review."** Both items above were implemented. Each surfaced
a real bug beyond the feature itself, found live in Storybook, not by reading the code — the standing
pattern throughout this whole review.

**`onClear` — a clear button that replaces the caret whenever a value is selected.** Added to
`SelectProps`, wired through `Select.tsx`: `showClear` computes from an internal `effectiveValue`
that shadows the real `value`/`defaultValue`; clicking the clear `<button>` (a plain DOM sibling of
the trigger, positioned via `.triggerContainer`'s `position: relative` + `.clear`'s
`position: absolute; inset-inline-end` — never nested inside the trigger `<button>`, which would be
invalid HTML) calls `onClear`, resets the selection, and refocuses the trigger. `.trigger`'s own
`padding-inline-end` grows via a new `.sizeXClearable` variant when the clear button is showing, so
its icon never overlaps the selected value's own text — sized from the same tokens as `.clearX`'s own
per-size icon+padding, not a guessed value. `asChild` skips this entirely (warns in development if
`onClear` is passed alongside it, matching the established `placeholder`-with-`asChild` warning
pattern) — a custom trigger has no built-in caret slot for a clear button to take over.

**Real bug found live, not caught by any test beforehand:** the first working version passed
`undefined` as the "nothing selected" sentinel when resetting an uncontrolled selection. This made
Radix's own `value` prop genuinely flip between controlled and uncontrolled from *Radix's own*
perspective every time a selection was made (real string) vs. cleared (`undefined`) — exactly the
anti-pattern Radix's own `useControllableState` dev warning exists to catch ("Select is changing from
uncontrolled to controlled... Components should not switch..."), confirmed firing in the console.
Root-caused by reading `@radix-ui/react-use-controllable-state`'s actual source rather than guessing:
Radix's own internal "uncontrolled fallback" value gets set as a *side effect* of Select genuinely
being uncontrolled (from Radix's perspective) at the moment a selection is first made — since nothing
on this side can reach in and reset *that* internal value, flipping back to `undefined` later made
Radix silently resurface the stale, just-cleared value instead of the placeholder. Confirmed live via
temporary render-logging: this component's own state reset to `undefined` correctly every time, but
the trigger kept showing the old label regardless — proof the bug was entirely on Radix's side of the
boundary, not this one. Fixed by using `""`, never `undefined`, as the sentinel whenever `onClear` is
engaged — `"" !== undefined` keeps Radix permanently controlled from the first render onward, so its
internal fallback is never used at all. Re-verified live through repeated select→clear→select→clear
cycles (including a second, *different* value after a clear, and RTL via `dir="rtl"`, where the clear
button correctly mirrors via `inset-inline-end`) with zero stale values and zero console warnings.
`jest-axe`: 0 violations with the clear button shown.

**`Select.Option`'s own `asChild`** — a custom option row (e.g. a two-line label + description)
while keeping Radix's own listbox/typeahead/highlight behavior. Requires `textValue` (warns in
development without it): Radix's own selected-label projection needs a plain string to show in the
trigger once selected, not the custom row itself, so in `asChild` mode the custom row renders as
provided with an extra `ItemText` appended (sourced from `textValue`) purely to feed that projection.
`styles.option` isn't merged onto the custom row (`className` still passes through), matching the
established `SelectRoot`-level `asChild` precedent from finding #5.

**Second real bug found live:** the extra `ItemText` was meant to be invisible (`style={{ display:
"none" }}` directly on it) — instead it rendered fully visible, duplicating every custom row's own
label directly beneath it in the open dropdown. Root-caused by reading Radix's own `SelectItemText`
source: it destructures `style`/`className` out of its own props and never actually applies either to
its rendered node — both are silently dropped, a genuine Radix behavior, not a typo on this side.
Fixed by wrapping the extra `ItemText` in a plain `<span style={{ display: "none" }}>` instead, which
does respect inline styles; confirmed this doesn't interfere with Radix's own portal-based projection
into the trigger, since `ReactDOM.createPortal` moves that content to a completely different DOM node
(the trigger's own), which isn't a descendant of the hidden wrapper. Added a regression test that
specifically locates the hidden text and asserts *where* it lives (inside a `display: none` ancestor)
rather than just counting occurrences in `textContent` — confirmed by temporarily reverting the fix
that the naive count-based version of this test can never fail, since `textContent` ignores CSS
`display` entirely, while the ancestor-based version correctly fails on the bug and passes on the fix.

Two new demo stories (`Clearable`/"With a clear button", `CustomOptionRow`/"Custom option row
(Select.Option asChild)") added to `Select.stories.tsx` and `Select.mdx`'s own Variants section — the
first pass at documenting `Clearable` shipped without its own `<Canvas>` block in the Docs page,
caught and fixed while verifying the Docs page live rather than assuming the story alone was enough.
Both stories: 0 accessibility violations. Full suite re-run clean: `pnpm lint`; `vitest` unit (`Select`
41/41, up from 26); `storybook` project (383/383, up from 381); `tsup` build; `check-component-
bundle-size` (2.20KB JS / 1.19KB CSS gzipped, within budget).

## Status

Review pass complete, all findings actioned. **Not yet Finalized** — per
`06-engineering-standards.md` §9, only the user declares a component's review pass done.
