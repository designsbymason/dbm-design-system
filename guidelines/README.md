# Guidelines

Internal reference documents for the DBM Design System. This is where architecture decisions, specs, and standing context live — for Claude Code, other contributors, and future-you.

`CLAUDE.md` at the repo root is the short auto-read entry point; these documents are the detail behind it.

## Contents

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `01-vision-and-goals.md` | Project goals, target use cases (web/enterprise agentic UI generation), what "agentic" and "premium" mean for this system, scope, key decisions, open questions, and the roadmap phases |
| `02-tech-stack-and-structure.md` | Monorepo layout, the tech stack with rationale per tool, the free/OSS constraint, CI, and dependency-vulnerability handling |
| `03-token-system-spec.md` | The three-layer token architecture (primitive → semantic → component), the color/typography/spacing/radius/shadow/motion/breakpoint scales, multi-brand and light/dark theming, and the contrast-verification methodology and results |
| `04-component-inventory.md` | The full component list, atomic-design tiering (atoms/molecules/organisms/templates), priorities, and the build orders; the one place component counts live |
| `05-component-api-conventions.md` | Prop naming patterns, file structure, compound components, CSS/token conventions, and the per-component definition of done |
| `06-engineering-standards.md` | Clean code, scalability, stability and error handling, performance, responsiveness, browser/SSR targets, i18n stance, agent process rules, and the component review checklist |
| `07-storybook-and-documentation-standards.md` | Storybook infrastructure, sidebar taxonomy, the Docs-page template and building blocks, the rules for the code under each story's "Show code" button, the per-component checklist, and the status table of every built component |
| `adr/` | Individual, immutable Architecture Decision Records: the *why* behind a real fork-in-the-road decision. The numbered docs point here (`See ADR-0012`) instead of narrating a decision's reasoning inline. `adr/README.md` has the template, naming convention and the bar for what qualifies |
| `component-reviews/` | One file per component with a completed `06-engineering-standards.md` §9 review pass: what was checked, found and fixed, and its Finalized status and date. A living document per component, not immutable like `adr/`. `component-reviews/README.md` has the conventions |

## Reading order for new context (human or agent)

1. `01-vision-and-goals.md` — what we're building and why
2. `02-tech-stack-and-structure.md` — what it's built with and how the repo is organized
3. `03-token-system-spec.md` — the design token foundation everything else builds on
4. `04-component-inventory.md` — what components exist/are planned, and where each fits
5. `05-component-api-conventions.md` — how any given component must be written
6. `06-engineering-standards.md` — the code-quality and process discipline behind all of the above
7. `07-storybook-and-documentation-standards.md` — how a component's Storybook docs/showcase must meet the same bar as its code

`adr/` and `component-reviews/` aren't part of this linear reading order — both are lookup folders (the "why" behind a decision, and a specific component's own findings), consulted on demand rather than read start to finish.

## Conventions for this folder
- Numbered prefixes control reading order, not chronology — renumber if a doc's role changes.
- Each doc should be able to stand alone (a reader — human or agent — shouldn't need to hold the whole conversation history that produced it).
- **The numbered docs (`01`–`07`) are a current-state reference, not a changelog (`06-engineering-standards.md` §8).** `pnpm check-guidelines` (warn-only, also a CI step) flags the ways they drift: dated update notes, overlong lines, counts stated outside `04`, and links, section citations and index entries that no longer resolve. When a decision they document changes, update the doc in place rather than leaving stale guidance. Two exceptions, different from each other: **`adr/`** — an ADR is not rewritten in place: a changed decision gets a *new* ADR that supersedes the old one, and the one narrow exception is a small, dated, marked amendment to a *detail* when the decision itself hasn't changed (see `adr/README.md`). **`component-reviews/`** — a living document per component (see that folder's own README) that's expected to keep growing as a component's review continues; it's exempt from "current-state only" because per-component history is exactly what it's *for*, scoped tightly enough to stay bounded.
- Source-of-truth *data* (actual token JSON, component manifests) lives in `packages/`, not here — this folder is for decisions and rationale, not build artifacts.
- **This folder is public and permanent.** The repo is public, and git history doesn't forget — once something is committed and pushed here, treat it as visible forever, even if later removed. Never add secrets, credentials, personal identifying information, client/business-sensitive details, or anything not meant for permanent public visibility. If in doubt, leave it out or ask first rather than committing it.
