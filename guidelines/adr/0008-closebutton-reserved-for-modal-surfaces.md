# 0008 — `CloseButton` is reserved for modal-style overlay surfaces; tone-varying components get their own local remove control

**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-27 (established via Tag/CloseButton)

## Context
`Tag`'s removable variant originally reused `CloseButton` for its remove affordance. `Tag` needed its remove icon to track the tag's own local tone (red on a `danger` tag, etc.) — a requirement fundamentally incompatible with `CloseButton`'s fixed, brand-styled color (`icon.brand`, matching `IconButton`'s own `tertiary` variant exactly).

## Decision
`CloseButton` stays a fixed, brand-styled dismiss control — **reserved for surfaces where a modal-style overlay is involved** (Dialog, Drawer, lightbox, and similar cards/panels presenting over the rest of the page). These are genuinely standalone contexts with no local tone of their own to track, which is exactly what `CloseButton`'s fixed styling is designed for.

**Any component whose own tone/color varies per instance** (`Tag`; future `Toast`/`Alert`, and any future tone-driven molecule/organism) **implements its own local, self-contained remove/close button** instead, colored via that component's own existing tone-resolution logic. This applies even to components that are visually "standalone" in the sense of floating above other content (`Toast`/`Alert` notifications) — the deciding factor is whether the component has its own varying tone to track, not whether it visually floats.

**Default to the local, component-specific implementation unless `CloseButton` is explicitly requested** — don't reach for `CloseButton` automatically just because a component needs a dismiss affordance; treat it as an opt-in choice for the modal-surface case specifically, not the default building block every removable/dismissible component should reach for first.

## Alternatives considered
Extending `CloseButton` to accept a color/tone override so every removable component (including tone-varying ones like `Tag`) could keep reusing it — rejected. `Tag` was detached and given its own small, locally-implemented, tone-aware remove `<button>` instead (`Tag.module.css`'s `.removeButton`), rather than keep stretching one shared component to serve two fundamentally different coloring needs.

## Consequences
A clear, reusable test for every future dismissible component: does it have its own varying tone to track? If yes, build a local remove control (following `Tag`'s pattern). If no — a genuinely standalone modal-style surface — reach for `CloseButton`.
